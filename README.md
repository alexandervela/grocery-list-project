# QuickList

### Problem:

Grocery shopping when you have a large family can be a tedious and time consuming task. Everyone wants/needs different things. Going through each and every aisle while each person picks what they want can take forever. Splitting up can lead to confusion about who is getting what, some people taking longer than others, and duplicate items being picked and returning to the put those items back.

### Solution:

This is where QuickList comes in! QuickList is a full-stack web application that was designed to allow multiple users to create, read, update, and delete lists and list items all in real time. This allows the groceries to be acquired in the fastest possible way as everyone can go their seperate way and shop individually, while still keeping in sync about what items have been purchased and which are still needed through updates in the web app.
